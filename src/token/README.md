# Token Contract 🐜
The Token contract is a generalized smart contract for the EOSIO and Antelope blockchains that enables the creation and management of tokens. It supports a variety of actions that allow users to create, issue, and transfer tokens, as well as get balance information. See the outer [README](https://github.com/currentxchange/ANT-token-standard) for more information.
